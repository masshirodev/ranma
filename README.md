# ranma

A tiling window manager for the terminal: i3's container tree and Hyprland's
dwindle placement, where every window is a PTY. Sessions, workspaces, a floating
layer and a scratchpad, driven by a leader key and a modal WM mode, configured in
Lua and themed in TOML.

Named for the 欄間, the carved transom panel above sliding doors.

**Status:** configuration only. The window manager itself is milestone 1 of
[`doc/ROADMAP.md`](doc/ROADMAP.md).

```sh
cargo run -- --dump-config    # the default init.lua, which documents every option
cargo run -- --check-config   # validate ~/.config/ranma/init.lua and its theme
```
